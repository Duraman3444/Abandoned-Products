# Demo Page Screenshot Placeholder

This file represents where the demo page screenshot would be stored.

The screenshot should show:
- Hero section with SchoolDriver Modern title and metrics
- Six feature cards in responsive grid layout
- Interactive elements like charts and search boxes  
- Call-to-action buttons at bottom
- Mobile and desktop responsive views

To capture the actual screenshot:
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/demo/
2. Take full-page screenshot showing all features
3. Replace this placeholder with the actual PNG file
