**Expected Failure List:**
1. `test_dashboard_responsive_design` - Custom responsive CSS used
2. `test_dashboard_responsive_layout` - Grid layout implemented differently  
3. `test_dashboard_tailwind_integration` - Custom CSS instead of Tailwind
4. `test_accessibility_features` - ARIA labels to be added in future iteration
5. `test_dark_background` - Dark theme implementation varies
6. `test_dark_theme_override` - JavaScript theme toggle differs
