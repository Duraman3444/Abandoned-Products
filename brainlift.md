# üß† Brain-Lift Log

> ‚ÄúBrain-lift‚Äù = the process of rapidly absorbing a legacy codebase and then elevating it with AI-assisted tooling.

This log summarises how artificial-intelligence workflows were used to understand *SchoolDriver Modern*, migrate features, and accelerate development.

## 1. Discovery & Comprehension

| Step | AI Method | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| üìÇ Codebase Scan | *Semantic search* ‚Üí ‚ÄúHow does authentication work?‚Äù | Isolated legacy auth flow & permissions |
| üîç Model Mapping | *GPT-4* prompt: ‚ÄúGenerate UML from these Django models‚Äù | Visual map of 50+ models with relations |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Dependency Audit | *LLM chain* + `pipdeptree` output | Identified outdated packages & quick upgrades |

### Key Prompt
```text
"Explain the responsibility of each app in this Django project and rank them by coupling." 
```

## 2. Modernisation Strategy

1. **Architecture Blueprint** ‚Äì LLM produced a side-by-side mermaid diagram (legacy vs modern).  
2. **Risk Matrix** ‚Äì AI scored migration tasks by effort vs impact.  
3. **Incremental Plan** ‚Äì Generated 6-phase roadmap (models ‚Üí APIs ‚Üí UI ‚Üí tests ‚Üí docs ‚Üí deploy).

## 3. Implementation Workflows

### 3.1 Model Migration
* Prompted GPT with diff chunks ‚áí produced Django 4.2-ready models.
* Added `on_delete` params, UUID PKs, and docstrings automatically.

### 3.2 API Generation
* LLM turned models into DRF `ModelViewSet`s + serializers.
* Auto-annotated with `extend_schema` for Spectacular ‚Üí instant OpenAPI docs.

### 3.3 Front-End Enhancements
* ChatGPT generated Chart.js configs for real-time analytics.
* ‚ÄúWhite-out‚Äù bug fixed via AI-suggested CSS variable theming.

### 3.4 Testing & QA
* Generated factory-boy fixtures.  
* Wrote Playwright scripts to ensure dark-mode contrast ‚â• 4.5:1.

## 4. Toolchain

| Category | Tool | Usage |
|----------|------|-------|
| LLM | GPT-4 / o3 | Prompt engineering, code generation |
| Schema | *drf-spectacular* | Schema export for AI context |
| Diagrams | Mermaid | Auto-drawn from prompts |
| Lint / Fix | Ruff, Black | AI suggested config presets |
| Docs | GitHub Copilot-Chat | Inline docstring creation |

## 5. Lessons Learned

1. **Small Prompts, Big Wins** ‚Äì Precise, task-scoped prompts outperformed long, multi-step ones.
2. **Iterate with the Diff** ‚Äì Feeding the *diff* back to the AI prevented context overflow and kept conversations grounded.
3. **Automate the Boring** ‚Äì CRUD APIs, test boilerplate, and CSS tweaks were perfect AI fodder; business rules still needed human nuance.

## 6. Next-Up Ideas

* Automatic pull-request description generation.  
* LLM-powered accessibility audits.  
* Conversation-driven data-migration assistant.
