   - Status: Not started

2. **API Development**
   - Timeline: 1-2 days  
   - Files: `api/` directory, serializers, viewsets
   - Status: Not started

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Timeline: 1 day
   - Files: `tests/` directories across apps
   - Status: Minimal tests exist

### Medium Priority
4. **AI Documentation Creation**
   - Timeline: 0.5 days
   - Files: `docs/AI_METHODOLOGY.md`, `docs/AI_PROMPTS.md`
   - Status: Not started

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Timeline: 0.5 days
   - Files: Various optimization across views/models
   - Status: Basic optimization done

6. **Security Hardening**
   - Timeline: 0.5 days
   - Files: Settings, middleware, view security
   - Status: Basic security in place

## Technical Debt & Polish

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add type hints throughout Python code
- [ ] Implement proper logging across all modules
- [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Code formatting with ruff/black consistency

- [ ] Environment variable documentation

## Success Metrics Dashboard

### Current Progress: **~70% Complete**
- **Legacy Understanding**: ‚úÖ 100%
- **Features**: üîÑ 67% (4/6 complete)
- **Technical Quality**: üîÑ 75% 
- **AI Documentation**: ‚ùå 0%

### Target for Completion:
- **Features**: Need 2 more substantial features
- **Testing**: Achieve 80%+ code coverage
- **Documentation**: Complete AI methodology guide
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms page load times

## Next Steps (Recommended Order)

1. **Implement Advanced Search** (Day 1)
   - Create search app with global search functionality
   - Add filtering for academic records
   - Test search performance with large datasets

2. **Build API Layer** (Day 2)
   - Set up DRF with proper serializers
   - Create API endpoints for core models
   - Add API documentation and testing

3. **Comprehensive Testing** (Day 3 Morning)
   - Write tests for all new features
