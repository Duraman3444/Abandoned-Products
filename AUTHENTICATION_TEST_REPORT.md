### 3. Role-Based Access Control ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Status:** Partially Working

**Current Behavior:**
- Admin users redirect to `/admin/` instead of `/dashboard/`
- This appears to be by design but differs from expected modern dashboard flow
- Both `/admin/` and `/dashboard/` are accessible to admin users

**Recommendation:**
- Consider updating `LOGIN_REDIRECT_URL` to point to `/dashboard/` for modern interface
- Current behavior may be intentional for admin workflow

### 4. Dashboard Functionality ‚úÖ
**Status:** Excellent

**Features Confirmed:**
- Dashboard loads successfully at `/dashboard/`
- Contains analytics charts and visualizations
- Modern navigation elements
- User profile access
- Admin interface integration
- Responsive design elements

**Performance:** Fast loading and rendering

### 5. Session Management ‚úÖ
**Status:** Working Perfectly

- Session cookies persist correctly
- Cross-request session maintenance working
- Secure session handling

### 6. Security Implementation ‚úÖ
**Status:** Strong Security Posture

**Security Features:**
- ‚úÖ CSRF tokens present and enforced
- ‚úÖ X-Frame-Options header set
- ‚úÖ X-Content-Type-Options header set
- ‚úÖ Secure session handling
- ‚úÖ Input validation working

### 7. Logout Functionality ‚ùå
**Status:** Technical Issue

**Problem:** Django's built-in LogoutView requires POST with CSRF token
**Error:** 403 Forbidden when attempting logout
**Root Cause:** Missing CSRF token in logout request

**Fix Required:**
```python
# Need to include CSRF token in logout forms
<form method="post" action="{% url 'logout' %}">
    {% csrf_token %}
    <button type="submit">Logout</button>
</form>
```

### 8. Password Reset ‚ùå
**Status:** Not Implemented

**Issue:** Returns 404 for `/accounts/password/reset/`
**Impact:** Users cannot reset forgotten passwords
**Priority:** Medium (admin can reset manually via Django admin)
