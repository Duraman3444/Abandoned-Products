- **Backup Plan:** Use CDN links instead of local files

#### **Authentication Complexity**
- **Issue:** Role-based permissions too complex
- **Solution:** Start with basic roles, expand incrementally
- **Backup Plan:** Focus on UI improvements over complex permissions

#### **Time Constraints**
- **Issue:** Features taking longer than expected
- **Solution:** Prioritize core functionality over polish
- **Backup Plan:** Implement dashboard first (higher impact)
