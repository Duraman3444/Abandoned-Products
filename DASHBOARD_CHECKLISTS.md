# SchoolDriver Dashboard Development Checklists

## 🎯 **RECOMMENDATION: Start with Teachers/Staff Dashboard**

**Why Teachers/Staff First:**
- Teachers are primary data creators (grades, attendance, assignments)
- Parents consume information that teachers input
- Daily active users vs periodic parent check-ins
- Better teacher tools = better parent experience
- Foundation for parent dashboard functionality
