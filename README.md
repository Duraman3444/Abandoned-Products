    J --> L
    K --> L
    
    L --> M[Documentation Generation]
    L --> N[Visual Diagram Creation]
```

### Key AI-Assisted Achievements

1. **Legacy Code Comprehension** (2 hours → 30 minutes)
   - AI helped rapidly understand 1M+ lines of legacy Python/Django code
   - Identified core business logic patterns and relationships
   - Mapped complex data dependencies

2. **Modern Architecture Design** (1 day → 4 hours)
   - AI-assisted database schema modernization
   - Generated Django 4.2+ compatible models with proper relationships
   - Automated UUID-based primary key implementation

3. **Feature Implementation** (3 days → 1 day)
   - AI-generated admin interface enhancements
   - Automated document upload system with preview functionality
   - Created comprehensive sample data generation

4. **Visual Documentation** (4 hours → 1 hour)
   - AI-assisted Mermaid diagram generation
   - Automated architecture comparison visualizations
   - Generated comprehensive README documentation

### Sample AI Prompts Used

**Legacy Analysis:**
```
"Analyze this Django codebase and identify the core business logic 
for student admission management, including data models, workflows, 
and key relationships that must be preserved in modernization."
```

**Model Generation:**
```
"Create modern Django 4.2+ models that preserve the business logic 
of this legacy admission system, using UUID primary keys, proper 
relationships, and modern field types."
```

**Admin Enhancement:**
```
"Design an enhanced Django admin interface that displays admission 
progress visually, shows document upload status with previews, 
and provides intuitive bulk actions for staff users."
```
